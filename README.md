The more you drink the worse you'll feel. But that's the only way to get back health. Shoot enemies, drink vodka to regain health and eat cucumbers to make the effects of alcohol weaker. 

GOAL: Go through the secret military base, get through all the doors and kill the boss at the end. There is even a maze with no walls. What can go wrong, right?

CONTROLS:

- WASD for movement
- LMB to shoot
- V to attack with a knife (Yes, we know, the animation of this is terrible...)
